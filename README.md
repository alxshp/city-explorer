# City Explorer

City Explorer is an Angular-based web application that allows users to explore a list of cities, add new cities, and manage their favorites. The app provides two views: a list view and a tile view, and includes functionality for adding, viewing, and deleting cities.

## Features

- **List View and Tile View**: Switch between a list and tile layout to view cities.
- **Add New City**: Users can create a new city by providing a name, description, and image URL.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark cities as favorites and toggle their favorite status.
- **Navigation**: Simple navigation between the city list and the form to create a new city.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
